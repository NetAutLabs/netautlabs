# Open-Source Network Automation Labs

Over the next few weeks, we will continuously add new labs. Our ultimate goal is to develop a community-driven lab collection.

Currently, the planned structure is as follows, though it may change over time:

- Exercises range from small to large and cater to beginners and professionals. Micro labs are maintained directly in the main repository, while larger labs, which may require additional files or setup, have individual repositories that can be forked and/or cloned.
- GitHub Discussions can be used to share solutions and engage in discussions.
- Lab Categories include
  - Configuration management
    - Ansible
    - Terraform
    - SaltStack
    - StackStorm
    - ...
  - Python Automation
    - NAPALM
