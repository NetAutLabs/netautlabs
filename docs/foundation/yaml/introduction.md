# Introduction

YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) is a human-readable data serialization standard that is commonly used for configuration files and data exchange between languages with different data structures. It will be extremely useful in your network automation projects. If you are not familiar with YAML, there are many excellent tutorials and resources available.
